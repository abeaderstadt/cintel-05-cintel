## **Repeatable Project Workflow**

### **2. Activate the Project Virtual Environment:**
  - .venv\Scripts\activate
### **3. Install Dependencies As Needed:**
  - py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
### **4. Run Scripts as needed:**
  - select python interpreter for your local venv
  - py myfile.py   
### **5. Run Jupyter Notebooks as needed:**
 - click the kernel selector in the top-right corner of the notebook editor and choose the interpreter associated with your .venv.
 - Click on a cell and press Shift+Enter to execute it and move to the next cell.
